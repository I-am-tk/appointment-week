  ```

  className="content"
  from={{ hours: 6 }}
  to={{ hours: 12 }}
  appointments={DUMMY_APPOINTMENT_DATA}
  dateOfWeek={new Date()}
  renderSlot={(slot, onClick) => {
    const isReserved = slot.slotType === "RESERVED";
    const isSelected = slot.slotType === "AVAILABLE" && slot.isSelected;
    return (
      <div
        className={`slot ${isReserved ? "reserved" : "available"} ${
          isSelected ? "selected" : ""
        }`}
        onClick={() => onClick(slot.id)}
      >
        {formatSlotTime(slot.startTime, slot.endTime)}
      </div>
    );
  }}
  renderTitle={(date) => (
    <div className={`group-title`}>{formatSlotTitle(date)}</div>
  )}
  maxReservationAllowed={3}
  slotDuration={30}
/>
```
